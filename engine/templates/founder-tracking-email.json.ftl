  Mailpit /api/v1/send payload for the "Send applicant tracking email"
  service task in business-registration.bpmn.

  Sent once at the start of the co-founder signing phase. The applicant is
  pre-confirmed by the form submission, so the link mainly
  exists so the applicant sees the same page as every other co-founder
  and can click "Submit to register" once the round of signatures
  completes.

  Scope: process variables applicantFirstName, applicantLastName,
  applicantEmail, additionalFounders, companyName; reserved beans
  frontendBaseUrl and links. The token is minted by
  links.founder(execution, "applicant") and never stored (docs/security.md
  rule 3).
-->
<#assign fullName = (applicantFirstName!"") + " " + (applicantLastName!"")>
<#assign signUrl = frontendBaseUrl + "/sign-founder/" + links.founder(execution, "applicant")>
<#assign extraCount = additionalFounders.elements()?size>
<#assign body>Tere ${applicantFirstName!""},

Your registration for ${companyName!""} has been submitted and is now
waiting for ${extraCount} co-founder signature<#if extraCount != 1>s</#if>
before it can be sent to the Business Register.

Track the signatures and forward the case once everyone has signed:
${signUrl}

Your own signature is recorded automatically. Once every co-founder has
signed, any founder can click "Submit to register" on the page above.
