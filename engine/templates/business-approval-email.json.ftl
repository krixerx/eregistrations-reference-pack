  Mailpit /api/v1/send payload for the businessRegistration approval email.
  Variables in scope: companyName, shareCapital, applicantFirstName,
  applicantLastName, applicantEmail, boardMembers (Spin Json list),
  autoDecision, decision, feeInvoicePdfBytes (raw PDF bytes, written by
  the preceding Task_GenerateFeeInvoicePdf) and feeInvoicePdfFilename,
  plus the execution properties.

  All string fields escaped with ?json_string. boardMembers iterated via
  Spin's elements() iterator and stringified for the human-readable body.

  Synthesises a Business Register code from the process instance id so
  the email reads like a real Äriregister confirmation. Demo only — the
  real code is allocated by the registry.

  We base64-encode the PDF bytes here (rather than carrying a base64
  String process variable) because String variables in CIB seven cap at
  4000 chars in ACT_HI_VARINST.TEXT_. Same byte[]→base64 trip as
  personReg's approval-email.json.ftl.

  Recipient is the applicant's own email — Gateway_SendApprovalEmail
  upstream guarantees it is non-null and contains '@' before this
  template runs.

  The pay link carries a payment capability token minted by
  links.payment(execution) (docs/security.md rules 3 and 4), not the
  process instance id.

extract will be issued.

Business Register code:  ${regCode}
Company:                 ${(companyName!"")}
Share capital:           ${capitalNumber?string("0.00")} EUR
Founder residency:       ${residencyLabel}
Board members:
${members}
Decision made by:        ${((autoDecision!"")=="approve")?then("automated decision table (DMN)", "manual review by the Business Register")}
