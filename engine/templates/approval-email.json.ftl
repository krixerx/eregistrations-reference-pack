  Mailpit /api/v1/send payload for the "Send state fee invoice email"
  service task in vehicle-registration.bpmn. Sent when the applicant
  provided an email address; attaches the State fee invoice PDF
  produced by the preceding "Generate state fee invoice" task.

  Variables in scope: firstName, lastName, age, objectId (vehicle code),
  price (vehicle value), applicantEmail, approvalPdfBytes
  (raw PDF bytes — the state fee invoice), approvalPdfFilename.

  The BPMN gateway guarantees applicantEmail is non-null and contains '@'
  before this template runs, but we still null-default to keep the
  template robust if invoked from a different path. ?json_string escapes
  embedded quotes/backslashes/newlines so the payload is always valid
  JSON. We base64-encode the PDF bytes here (rather than carrying a
  base64 String process variable) because String variables in CIB seven
  cap at 4000 chars in ACT_HI_VARINST.TEXT_.

  The Vehicle Registration Certificate is generated immediately after
  this email and stored as a process Attachment — visible in the
  Documents card. A future PR (payment step) will email it once the
  state fee is paid.

  The pay link carries a payment capability token minted by
  links.payment(execution) (docs/security.md rules 3 and 4), not the
  process instance id.

<#assign fullName = (firstName!"") + " " + (lastName!"")>

<#-- price can surface as a locale-formatted String ("38,000") on some
     engine→FreeMarker paths — same defensive coercion as approval-pdf. -->
<#assign rawPrice = (price!0)>
<#if rawPrice?is_number>
  <#assign vehicleValue = rawPrice>

  <#assign vehicleValue = rawPrice?replace(",", "")?replace(" ", "")?replace(" ", "")?replace("$", "")?replace("€", "")?number>

<#assign body>Hi ${firstName!""},

Your vehicle registration with Transpordiamet has been approved. The
State fee invoice is attached — pay the listed amount to complete the
registration. Once the payment is received, your Vehicle Registration
Certificate (tehniline pass) will be issued.

Owner: ${fullName}
Vehicle code: ${objectId!""}
Vehicle value: €${vehicleValue?string("0.00")}

Pay the state fee here:
${payUrl}

Thanks,
Transpordiamet POC</#assign>
