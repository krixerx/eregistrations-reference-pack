# Co-signing: `founder`

Every co-founder the applicant lists must sign the Articles of Association
through a link in their email before the case goes to the Business Register.
The page is the SPA's one consent page, `/consent/founder/{token}`, worded by the pack's `consent:founder.*` texts; its API is the backend's
generic co-signing endpoint `/api/public/consent/founder/{token}`.

**Purpose:** `founder` (the capability token's purpose and the URL segment)
**Process:** `businessRegistration`
**Applicant name variables:** `applicantFirstName`, `applicantLastName`
