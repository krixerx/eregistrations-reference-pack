# businessRegistration — guidance for the LLM

This service registers a new Estonian private limited company (OÜ). It's
the headliner of the spec-first × MCP demo: one markdown spec produces the
BPMN, React forms, DMN, this manifest, and this training markdown — and
Claude Desktop can drive the entire flow without the applicant opening a
portal.

## What to ask the user for

To start a businessRegistration, you need these pieces of information
(name and email are added automatically — see the note below):

- **companyName** — the trade name. Must end in "OÜ" (limited liability).
  If the user gives "Acme" without the suffix, ask whether to append it
  before calling start_process — the form rejects names without it and an
  Ajv error is more annoying than one clarifying question.
- **boardMembers** — list of board members, each with first name, last
  name, and 11-digit Estonian personal code (isikukood). Minimum one.
- **shareCapital** — share capital in EUR. Must be at least 2500 (historical
  Estonian Commercial Code minimum). Below that, ask whether the user
  meant a different company form (sole proprietorship, MTÜ non-profit).
- **applicantAge** — the applicant's age in years. Call
  query_user_history('applicantAge') before asking and pre-fill if found.

The applicant's **first name, last name, and email are filled automatically
from their signed-in account** — do NOT ask for them or send them. The engine
writes them at process start and re-validates them on completion; a forged
value is refused with an HTTP 400.

Do NOT include `initiator` in your start_process call. The engine sets it
from the authenticated Keycloak user automatically.

## MCP-path scope (what chat can and cannot do)

The chat path registers a **sole-founder OÜ only**, and two web-portal
capabilities are deliberately not reachable over MCP. Tell the user up front
when their request needs one of these — don't let them discover it after
starting the process:

- **Co-founder e-signatures** — the multi-founder flow keys off an
  `additionalFounders` variable and drives per-founder signing via public
  tracking links the engine emails out. MCP cannot send `additionalFounders`
  (the start schema is closed) and has no tool to correlate the signature
  receive task, so every chat-started registration is a single-founder OÜ.
- **Articles of Association upload** — the AoA document upload has no field in
  the MCP manifest, so no AoA is attached on the chat path.

One more thing to set expectations on: because the applicant's email is now
always known (filled from their account), an approved registration generates a
state-fee invoice + approval email and then waits at a payment step
(the pay link in the approval email). There is no MCP payment tool, so over chat the
case completes up to that payment step and the user pays on the web. Everything
before payment — sole-founder registration, auto-approval, civil-servant
review, the send-back loop — works end-to-end over chat.

## Auto-approval rule

**Demo mode is on: every registration goes to civil-servant review.** The
first rule of the business-auto-approval DMN matches every case, so
autoDecision is always "review". Tell the user their application will be
reviewed by a civil servant; never promise auto-approval.

The underlying policy (inactive while demo mode is on) evaluates
`applicantAge`, `shareCapital` and `applicantResidency` with FIRST hit policy:

- `shareCapital < 2500` → autoDecision = "review" (manual review)
- `applicantAge < 18` → autoDecision = "review"
- `applicantResidency = "foreign"` → autoDecision = "review"
- adult citizen or e-resident with `shareCapital >= 2500` → autoDecision = "approve"
- anything else → autoDecision = "review"

Auto-approved cases skip the civil-servant queue and end immediately with
an approval email. Reviewed cases route to a civil servant who can accept
or send back with a reason.

Outside demo mode you could predict the outcome from the start_process
input alone (no service-task lookup like vehicleRegistration's price).

## After start_process

The engine creates the "Submit business details" user task assigned to the
applicant. The variables you passed at start time are pre-filled.

Since complete_task is already wired (eng-review T9), you can finish the
applicant task directly via MCP — call complete_task with the same
variables (or corrected ones if the user wants to change); name and email are
already on the instance and must not be resent. Once completed,
the engine runs the DMN, then either auto-approves (process ends, approval
email sent) or routes to civil-servant review.

If the case is sent back with a reason, the applicant returns to the same
business-details task with `sendBackReason` set. The MCP agent should:

1. Detect via query_user_history('sendBackReason') that a previous attempt
   was sent back.
2. Surface the reason to the user.
3. Offer to correct the previous submission rather than starting from
   scratch.

## Status interpretation

Use list_my_processes to check status. Map the engine state to user-facing
language:

- Process instance `running`, "Submit business details" task open →
  applicant hasn't confirmed yet (or sent back and awaiting correction).
- Process instance `running`, no user tasks open →
  in transit through the DMN or a service task. Retry in a few seconds.
- Process instance `running`, "Review business registration" task open →
  with civil servant. Typical 1-2 business days in production; in this
  POC the reviewer (Homer) usually acts immediately.
- Process instance `completed` → either auto-approved or accepted by
  civil servant. Check history for the final `autoDecision` and `decision`
  variables to tell which path it took.

## Common applicant questions

- **"Can I register multiple OÜs at once?"** — No, one process per OÜ.
  The engine does not deduplicate; the applicant may legitimately register
  several companies in sequence.
- **"What if I don't have a personal code for one of the board members?"**
  — A real registration requires it (Estonian state ID). For non-residents
  there's a separate process (e-Residency or alien personal code) that
  the POC doesn't cover; ask the user to obtain one first.
- **"Can I change the share capital after registration?"** — Not via
  this service. Production would expose a separate `capitalChange` service.
- **"My case was sent back, can I see the reason?"** — Yes, call
  query_user_history('sendBackReason') for the user's running instance —
  the reviewer's reason is stored as a process variable and survives
  history queries.
