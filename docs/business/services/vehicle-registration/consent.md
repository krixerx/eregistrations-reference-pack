# Co-signing: `owner`

Every co-owner the applicant lists must confirm the registration through a
link in their email before the case reaches Transport Authority. The page is
the SPA's one consent page, `/consent/owner/{token}`, worded by the pack's `consent:owner.*` texts; its API is the backend's generic
co-signing endpoint `/api/public/consent/owner/{token}`.

**Purpose:** `owner` (the capability token's purpose and the URL segment)
**Process:** `vehicleRegistration`
**Applicant name variables:** `firstName`, `lastName`
