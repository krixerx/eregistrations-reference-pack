# Vehicle Registration

**Status:** active (POC)
**Process key:** `vehicleRegistration`
**BPMN:** [`packs/reference/engine/processes/vehicle-registration/vehicle-registration.bpmn`](../../../../engine/processes/vehicle-registration/vehicle-registration.bpmn)
**DMN:** [`packs/reference/engine/processes/vehicle-registration/vehicle-auto-approval.dmn`](../../../../engine/processes/vehicle-registration/vehicle-auto-approval.dmn)

**When to read this:** before changing the vehicle-registration flow, its forms,
or its integrations. Cross-cutting topics (platform architecture, engine config,
form contract) live in [`docs/architecture.md`](../../../../../../docs/architecture.md),
[`docs/cib7.md`](../../../../../../docs/cib7.md), [`docs/frontend.md`](../../../../../../docs/frontend.md),
and [`docs/human-role-react-forms-spec.md`](../../../../../../docs/human-role-react-forms-spec.md).

## Catalog

How the services page and the payment page present the service. Generated
into the pack's `frontend/catalog.json` and `frontend/locales/<lang>/catalog.json`.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Category | `travel` |
| Summary | en: Register a vehicle from the national catalog. · ar: سجّل مركبة من الدليل الوطني. |
| Fee name | en: Vehicle registration state fee · ar: الرسوم الحكومية لتسجيل المركبة |
| Issuer | `transport-authority`, tone `primary`: name Transpordiamet POC (both languages); sub en: Estonian Transport Authority · ar: هيئة النقل الإستونية |

Display names (process, task and activity `name=` in the BPMN) are
translated in the pack's `names` namespace; see the service-builder
skill §8.1.

## What this service does

An applicant submits personal details and optionally a list of co-owners.
When co-owners are listed, the engine emails each one a signed capability
link to a public confirmation page; every co-owner has to approve before the case
can proceed. Once all co-owners have signed, any owner can click "Send to
process" to forward the case to the engine — at which point it follows
the original path: fetch a price from an external API, run a DMN decision
to see whether the case auto-approves, and otherwise route to a civil
servant for review. The civil servant can approve or send the case back
for corrections (which loops to the applicant). On approval, the applicant
is emailed if they provided a valid address. A rejection from any co-owner
also loops the case back to the applicant, with the rejection reason.

`SubProcess_OwnerConfirmations` is a parallel multi-instance embedded
subprocess; inside each instance the BPMN runs `Send owner confirmation
email` → `Wait for owner confirmation` (receiveTask, message
`OwnerConfirmation` correlated on local `partyId`). The instance count
comes from the `additionalOwners` collection variable at runtime, and the
subprocess completes early as soon as any instance writes
`rejectedByOwner=true` at process scope.

## Forms

| Form id (registry key) | BPMN task | Audience | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| `owner-vehicle` | `Task_SubmitDetails` | applicant (initiator) | [`forms/owner-vehicle.md`](forms/owner-vehicle.md) |
| `vehicle-review` | `Task_Review` | `civil-servant` group | [`forms/vehicle-review.md`](forms/vehicle-review.md) |
| n/a (public page) | n/a — public REST | each co-owner (email link) | [`frontend/src/pages/ConsentPage.tsx`](../../../../../../frontend/src/pages/ConsentPage.tsx) (`/consent/owner/<token>`) |

Form contract: see [`docs/human-role-react-forms-spec.md`](../../../../../../docs/human-role-react-forms-spec.md).
Registry resolution lives in `frontend/src/forms/registry.ts`. The owner
confirmation page is NOT a BPMN form — it's a public, unauthenticated SPA
route reached from `${frontendBaseUrl}/consent/owner/{token}` email links
and backed by `/api/public/consent/owner/**`, the backend's generic co-signing
endpoint configured by [`consent.md`](consent.md)
([`ConsentController`](../../../../../../backend/src/main/java/com/poc/backend/consent/ConsentController.java)).

## Service tasks (integrations)

One spec per BPMN service task; each gives the request, the payload template and the response mapping. Outbound calls all go to `${busBaseUrl}` (the bus). Email bodies and PDFs are hand-designed pack documents under `packs/reference/engine/documents/`, which the payload templates only wrap.

| BPMN task | Name | Kind | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Task_AttachIdDocument` | Attach owner ID document | case document (backend) | [`service-tasks/attach-id-document.md`](service-tasks/attach-id-document.md) |
| `Task_GenerateCertificatePdf` | Generate vehicle registration certificate | PDF (pdf-renderer) | [`service-tasks/generate-certificate-pdf.md`](service-tasks/generate-certificate-pdf.md) |
| `Task_GeneratePdf` | Generate state fee invoice | PDF (pdf-renderer) | [`service-tasks/generate-fee-invoice-pdf.md`](service-tasks/generate-fee-invoice-pdf.md) |
| `Task_GetPrice` | Look up vehicle in registry | registry read (backend) | [`service-tasks/look-up-vehicle.md`](service-tasks/look-up-vehicle.md) |
| `Task_QuoteFee` | Quote state fee | fee quote (backend) | [`service-tasks/quote-state-fee.md`](service-tasks/quote-state-fee.md) |
| `Task_SendApprovalEmail` | Send state fee invoice email | email (Mailpit) | [`service-tasks/send-fee-invoice-email.md`](service-tasks/send-fee-invoice-email.md) |
| `Task_SendOwnerConfirmEmail` | Send co-owner signing email | email (Mailpit) | [`service-tasks/send-owner-signing-email.md`](service-tasks/send-owner-signing-email.md) |
| `Task_SendApplicantTrackingEmail` | Send owner tracking email | email (Mailpit) | [`service-tasks/send-owner-tracking-email.md`](service-tasks/send-owner-tracking-email.md) |
| `Task_SendReminderEmail` | Send reviewer reminder email | email (Mailpit) | [`service-tasks/send-reviewer-reminder-email.md`](service-tasks/send-reviewer-reminder-email.md) |
| `Task_SendBackEmail` | Send "sent back" email | email (Mailpit) | [`service-tasks/send-sendback-email.md`](service-tasks/send-sendback-email.md) |
| `Task_StoreCertificatePdf` | Store registration certificate | case document (backend) | [`service-tasks/store-certificate-pdf.md`](service-tasks/store-certificate-pdf.md) |
| `Task_StoreApprovalPdf` | Store fee invoice | case document (backend) | [`service-tasks/store-fee-invoice-pdf.md`](service-tasks/store-fee-invoice-pdf.md) |

## Decisions

| BPMN task | DMN | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| `Task_AutoDecide` | `vehicle-auto-approval` (`singleEntry` -> `autoDecision`) | [`decisions/vehicle-auto-approval.md`](decisions/vehicle-auto-approval.md) |

## Receive tasks (message correlation)

| BPMN task | Message | Correlation | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ReceiveTask_OwnerConfirmation` (in subprocess) | `OwnerConfirmation` | local `partyId` (set from `owner.partyId` via inputOutput) | `POST /api/public/consent/owner/{token}` (approve or reject). The backend takes `processInstanceId` and `partyId` from the verified token only. |
| `Task_WaitSendToProcess` | `SendToProcess` | `processInstanceId` | `POST /api/public/consent/owner/{token}/send` |
| `Task_WaitForPayment` | `PaymentReceived` | `processInstanceId` | The payment provider's signed callback `POST /api/public/payments/callback` (docs/security.md rule 4), after the applicant pays from the public `/pay/{token}` page. Sets `paymentReceived`, `paymentReference`, `paidAmount`. |

Confirmation and pay links carry a capability token minted by the `links`
bean (`CapabilityLinks`) when the email is rendered: an HMAC over the case,
the party, the purpose, the consent round and an expiry (14 days for
confirmations, 30 for payment). The token is never stored; the backend's
`CapabilityLinkVerifier` checks the signature, expiry, purpose and that the
round equals the case's current `consentRound`. Any failure is the same 404
(docs/security.md rule 3).

`busBaseUrl` (the integration bus address) and `frontendBaseUrl` are exposed
as JUEL variables by `BusConfiguration` and `FrontendConfiguration` in the
engine. Outbound email/PDF/backend calls all go to `${busBaseUrl}`; the bus
(`esb`, Apache Camel) routes each path to the real downstream system. The
`pdf` bean is `PdfHelper`, the `links` bean `CapabilityLinks`. See [`docs/cib7.md`](../../../../../../docs/cib7.md) for the
wiring.

## Process variables

| Variable | Set by | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `initiator` | start event | String | Login of the applicant who started the case. |
| `firstName`, `lastName`, `age` | `Task_SubmitDetails` | String, String, Integer | |
| `objectId` | `Task_SubmitDetails` | String | Selected product id (drives `Task_GetPrice`). |
| `applicantEmail` | `Task_SubmitDetails` | String | Required when `additionalOwners` is non-empty (tracking email + send-back loop); otherwise optional. |
| `additionalOwners` | `Task_SubmitDetails`, rewritten by `ConsentPartiesListener` | Json (Spin list) | The form writes `[{name, email}]`. The complete listener on `Task_SubmitDetails` keeps only those two fields and adds server-assigned `partyId`s (`p1`, `p2`, ...), so the stored value is `[{partyId, name, email}]`. Always set (empty list when none). Drives the multi-instance subprocess via `${additionalOwners.elements()}`. |
| `consentRound` | `ConsentPartiesListener` | Long | Replaced on every submission (epoch milliseconds). Signed into every confirmation link; links from an earlier round get 404. |
| `ownerConfirmations` | `ConsentPartiesListener` + `ConsentController (owner)` | Json (Spin map) | `{<partyId>: {status, signedAt, reason?}}`. Reset on every submission to the applicant (`"applicant"`) pre-set to `"approved"`. Updated on every approve / reject. |
| `rejectedByOwner` | `ConsentPartiesListener` (reset) + `ConsentController (owner)` (reject) | Boolean | Drives the multi-instance `completionCondition` and the post-subprocess `Gateway_AllConfirmed`. |
| `sentToProcess` | `ConsentPartiesListener` (reset) + `SendToProcess` correlation | Boolean | Surfaced to the SPA via the status endpoint. |
| `paymentReceived`, `paymentReference`, `paidAmount` | `PaymentReceived` correlation (signed provider callback) | Boolean, String, Double | Written only by the backend's payment callback after the provider signature and amount check. |
| `price` | `Task_GetPrice` | Double | Read from the REST response. |
| `autoDecision` | `Task_AutoDecide` (DMN) | String | `"approve"` or `"review"`. |
| `decision` | `Task_Review` | String | `"approve"` or `"sendback"`. |
| `sendBackReason` | `Task_Review` OR `ConsentController (owner)` (reject) | String | Reason for the loop-back. Owner-reject path writes `"Owner <name> rejected the application: <reason>"` so the existing `Task_SendBackEmail` can render both kinds of send-back without a separate template. |
| `approvalPdfBytes` | `Task_GeneratePdf` | byte[] | Raw PDF bytes. Bytes-typed so the engine spills it to `ACT_GE_BYTEARRAY` instead of the 4000-char `TEXT_` column. |
| `approvalPdfFilename` | `Task_GeneratePdf` | String | Suggested attachment filename (e.g. `approval-<objectId>.pdf`). |

## Documents

The document categories this service files. Generated, together with the
other services' categories, into the pack's `backend/documents.json`; labels
go into the `catalog` texts as `documents.<category>`. `by: applicant` may be
uploaded by a signed-in user; `by: system` is filed only by the engine
through the internal endpoints (its name starts with `generated-`). The
issued certificate is the core's `generated-certificate`.

| Category | By | Label (en / ar) |
|---|---|---|
| `applicant-id-document` | applicant | ID document / وثيقة الهوية |
| `generated-approval-pdf` | system | Approval PDF / مستند الموافقة (PDF) |
| `generated-certificate` | system (core) | the vehicle registration certificate |

## State fee

What the applicant pays after approval. Generated into the pack's
`backend/payment/vehicle-registration.yaml`; the backend computes the fee
from it for the checkout, the provider callback and the engine's quote
([`quote-state-fee`](service-tasks/quote-state-fee.md)), so the invoice and
the charge cannot differ.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Fee name | Vehicle registration state fee |
| Recipient | Transpordiamet |
| Currency | EUR |
| Amount | by `price` (the registry value, set by `look-up-vehicle`): below 5000: 25; below 20000: 75; otherwise 150 |

The tier variable must be one the engine sets, never one a client writes
(docs/security.md rule 4); `PackConformanceTest` checks this.

## Variable write policy

The variables a client (SPA, MCP agent) may write, per start and per form.
`/service-builder` generates
`packs/reference/engine/processes/vehicle-registration/variable-policy.json` from this
table and `VariableWritePolicyFilter` refuses anything else with 403
(docs/security.md rule 2). Everything not listed here is system-owned.

| Start / form | Client may write | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| start | `age`, `objectId` | MCP `start_process` prefill; the SPA starts with no variables. |
| `owner-vehicle` | `firstName`, `lastName`, `applicantEmail`, `age`, `objectId`, `additionalOwners`, `pendingIdDocument`, `sendBackReason` | Identity fields re-validated by `IdentityValidationListener`. `sendBackReason` is only cleared. SPA-only (not in the MCP schema): `firstName`, `lastName`, `applicantEmail`, `sendBackReason`. |
| `vehicle-review` | `decision`, `sendBackReason` | The reviewer's decision; never on the applicant form. |

**Identity** (set from the signed-in account at start, re-checked on every
completion; `identity` in the policy): `firstName` = given name, `lastName`
= family name, `applicantEmail` = email.

System-owned: `initiator`, `ownerConfirmations`,
`rejectedByOwner`, `sentToProcess`, consent round and party ids, `price`,
vehicle lookup results, `autoDecision`, PDF and attachment variables.

## Roles and authorization

- **Applicant** — Keycloak group `applicant` (engine sees `applicant`, no
  leading slash; see project memory on the cibseven-keycloak group-path
  stripping). Owns `Task_SubmitDetails` via `camunda:assignee="${initiator}"`.
- **Civil servant** — Keycloak group `civil-servant`. Owns `Task_Review` via
  `candidateGroups="civil-servant"`.
- **Co-owners** — NOT Keycloak users. They authorise themselves to the
  public confirmation endpoints by presenting the capability token
  embedded in their email link. The `/api/public/**` filter chain
  ([`SecurityConfig`](../../../../../../backend/src/main/java/com/poc/backend/security/SecurityConfig.java))
  is `permitAll()`; the token IS the credential. It acts for one owner of
  one case in one round, and the status endpoint shows other owners' names
  and states only, never their email or link.

## Known trade-offs

- The boundary reminder uses `R/PT2M` for demo visibility. In production,
  switch to `R/PT1D` or `R/PT8H` in the BPMN.
- `applicantEmail` validation is defense-in-depth: HTML5 `type=email` in the
  form plus the exclusive gateway in BPMN. The service task never runs on bad
  data even if the form is bypassed.
- Send-back loop reuses the same `Task_SubmitDetails`. The form must accept
  both first-submit and resubmit modes — check the form for that.
- The token carries the process instance id, so lookup needs no scan and
  no token index.
- Resubmission after an owner reject starts a new consent round. Old
  confirmation links return 404 once the applicant resubmits, so a
  leaked-but-stale link can't be used to spoof a signature on a later
  round. Rotating `LINK_SIGNING_SECRET` invalidates every link at once.
- Treat the `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` env var like a secret-bearing redirect:
  the links it prefixes are credentials, so only set it to a host you
  control.
